Summary: 1. The D.O.C's second studio album, ​**"Helter Skelter"** (1996), was named in reference to ​Charles Manson's interpretation of The Beatles' song "Helter Skelter," which Manson associated with his apocalyptic vision of racial warfare 2. The Beatles' "Helter Skelter" (from their 1968 White Album) was written by ​Paul McCartney, who aimed to create a sound that was ​**"as loud and dirty as possible"**, marked by its aggressive, distorted guitar work and proto-metal intensity. 3. Manson misappropriated the song's title and themes, linking it to his delusional ideology of an impending race war ("Helter Skelter"), which he claimed was prophesied in The Beatles' lyrics. 4. The D.O.C's album title reflects Manson's twisted association with the song, rather than directly mirroring McCartney's original musical intent.
